Custom keymap for Let's Split. Used the Default layout on QMK as the base so all credit for the heavy coding goes to the author. 

Most of the layers are basically the same except for the raise and lower layers. These are edited to make it easier for heavy numpad users
and makes some characters for writing code easier to get to.
